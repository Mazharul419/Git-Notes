# Git Notes

## Intro

Git is the foundation of how teams ship code

Version control - tracks changes to code over time, see who changed what

Terraform files, modules, Kubernetes, Ansible etc files live in Git - so you can make change there.

SVN - single, central server - if it went down, could not commit, had to lock files when editing, merge conflicts common.

Git - distributed copies - resilient to outages, can work offline, everyone can commit

Git is not just a file tracker
